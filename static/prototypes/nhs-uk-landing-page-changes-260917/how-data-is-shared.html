        <h2>Patient health information</h2>

        <p>The NHS collects patient health information from everyone. This happens anytime you visit a health or social care professional. Certain organisations can request access to care information. If released, this data must be used to support the delivery
          of health and social care services in England.</p>

        <p>The information collected by the NHS is used to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>plan what care services are needed</li>
          <li>plan for health emergencies and epidemics</li>
          <li>improve medicines and treatments</li>
          <li>prevent illness and serious diseases</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Types of health data</h2>
          <div class="callout callout--info">
            <h3>Identifiable data</h3>
            <p>This contains personally identifiable details, like your name and NHS number.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="callout callout--info">
            <h3>Pseudonymised data</h3>
            <p>All personally identifiable details are replaced with a unique code. For example, a name is replaced with a unique number so the data is less identifiable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="callout callout--info">
            <h3>Anonymised data</h3>
            <p>All personally identifiable details are removed completely.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="callout callout--info">
            <h3>Aggregated data</h3>
            <p>Anonymised information is grouped together so that it doesn't identify individuals.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Request for information</h2>
          <p>An organisation that collects and uses identifiable information is known as a data controller. The data controller must provide details on why data is being collected and what it is being used for. They have a legal duty to let people know how
            their information is being used. </p>
          <p>We only give access to personally identifiable information if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>it will be used to promote health and care services in England</li>
            <li>the organisation will look after the data in accordance with law and good practice for <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/tsd/ig/" target="_blank">Information Governance (IG)</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p><a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/article/4981/Information-requests-from-organisations" target="_blank">More details on information requests</a></p>

        <hr />

        <div>
          <h2>Anonymising your data</h2>
          <p>We can protect your information by anonymising it. This removes any details that can identify you as a person, like your name and date of birth. Wherever possible, data will be anonymised and will follow the guidance set out by the Information
            Commissioner’s Office. This shows what details should be removed and how to protect the data.</p>
          <p>There are strict controls in place that regulate how personally identifiable data can be used. This is still true even if it isn’t possible to anonymise data. This may only be shared with your given permission or if required by law. </p>
        </div>

        <hr />

        <div>
          <h2>Legal contracts</h2>
          <p>A legal contract is signed between the NHS and the organisation requesting data before any information can be released, shared or used. This states the rules on what an organisation can do with shared data. It also contains clear limits on what cannot be done and what is strictly forbidden.</p>
          <p>A legal contract for data sharing will include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the type of data being shared</li>
            <li>how the data is being shared</li>
            <li>the purpose for sharing data</li>
            <li>a date for when the data must be destroyed</li>
            <li>data security conditions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An organisation cannot link this information with any other data, or use the data to re-identify a patient in any way. The information will never be sent to a third-party organisation or used for marketing purposes. An organisation may also
            be audited to ensure data is used appropriately.</p>
        </div>

        <hr />

        <h2>Fair processing notice</h2>
        <p>The information you provide is captured safely and securely. It is then stored by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) operating as NHS Digital. All data is stored in accordance with the Health &amp; Social Care Act 2012 and Health
          &amp; Social Care Act 2014 and in agreement with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
        <p>This will confirm your decision on whether or not to share your personally identifiable data for reasons beyond your direct care. It will also ensure your preferences do not change.</p>
        <p>Organisations may use your shared data for Research or Planning purposes. If you choose not to share, these organisations will be unable to use your data, unless it is needed for legal reasons (NHS Act 2006, Section 251).</p>
        <p>You have the right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to obtain information from the HSCIC if you want to know how data is stored and used.</p>
        <p>We also employ a third-party service, Google Analytics, to collect information on visitor behaviour. We collect these details so we can monitor the number of visitors that access certain parts of our service. It is not possible to identify anyone
          from this information. Both Google and NHS Digital will make no attempt to find out the identity of visitors to our website.</p>
        <p>All data stored by Google is subject to their <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. They collect details like the type of browser you use, the pages you visit and the amount of time you spend viewing
          each page. All of this information helps us to improve the site for future visitors. We will never use this information to track you or your activity online.</p>
